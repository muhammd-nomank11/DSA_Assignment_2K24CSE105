This repository includes three Java programs for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignment.  
Each program is written in simple code with comments to make it easy to understand.

Program Files:

1. BracketMatcher.java  :
    Checks if all brackets ( (), {}, [] ) are properly matched using a stack.

2. RecursiveArraySum.java  :
    Calculates the sum of all elements in an integer array using recursion.

3. ReverseArrayWithStack.java : 
    Reverses an array using the stack data structure (LIFO - Last In, First Out).

All programs can be run using any Java compiler or IDE.  
The code is organized, tested, and ready for review.

Thank you.
